# How to Use Speakerbot

Once Speakerbot has been installed in your Slack workspace, all users can interact with the bot to do several things:

* List new upcoming events
* Submit post-event reports
* View a weekly roundup of upcoming events
* View details of new event listings and reports as they are submitted
* Receive followup prompts to submit event reports once an event has occurred
* See a list of their own events that need reports

## Slash Commands

* Type `/speaking-new` in Slack and Speakerbot will open a new event form for you to fill out.
* Type `/speaking-report` in Slack and Speakerbot will open a post-event form for you to fill out.

## Shortcuts

Speakerbot provides [global shortcuts](https://api.slack.com/interactivity/shortcuts) that can be used to list upcoming speaking events and submit post-event reports. They can be accessed through the shortcut menu in Slack, which is represented by a lightning bolt icon on the bottome left of the message input area as shown below:
